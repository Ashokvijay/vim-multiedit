## About

These are the beginnings of a plugin that brings multi-selection editing (like in Sublime Text) to vim.

## Status

It's my first plugin and currently it supports only basic editing using insert mode. Current functionality is demoed in the following screencast: http://shelr.tv/records/4fef105a966080237e00005e
