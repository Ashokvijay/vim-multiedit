INTRODUCTION					    *multiedit-introduction*

Do you envy sublime text 2's multiple selection and editing? Let this plugin
try to fill that text cursor shaped gap in your heart.

Selections are added using <leader>m, and are highlighted. You can start
editing using <leader>I or an alternative (see |multiedit-mappings|).

When you've finished your edits the selections will reset by default.
