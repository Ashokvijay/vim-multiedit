INTRODUCTION					    *multiedit-introduction*

Do you envy Sublime Text 2's multiple selection and editing? This plugin
tries to fill that text cursor shaped gap in your heart.

It works by adding selection "regions" and allowing you to edit them in sync,
and offers you a multitude of ways to select those regions.

Mappings are added

Selections are added using <leader>m, and are highlighted. You can start
editing using <leader>I or an alternative (see |multiedit-mappings|).

When you've finished your edits the selections will reset by default.
